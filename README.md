# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes using a Random Forest classifier.

## Overview

This repository contains a Python program that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict whether an individual is likely to have diabetes based on their health indicators. The program uses a pre-trained Random Forest classifier and prompts the user to input various health metrics.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.6 or higher recommended).
3. Install the required libraries by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the `diabetes_prediction.py` script to use the diabetes prediction model.

## Usage

1. Run the `diabetes_prediction.py` script.
2. Enter the values for health indicators prompted by the program.
3. The program will predict whether the individual is likely to have diabetes.

## Example

```
Please provide the following information:
Number of Pregnancies: 2
Glucose level: 120
Blood Pressure: 70
Skin Thickness: 25
Insulin level: 100
BMI: 28.5
Diabetes Pedigree Function: 0.45
Age: 35

The model predicts that the user is likely to be diabetic.
```

## Note

- The program uses a pre-trained Random Forest classifier for prediction.
- This is a simple demonstration and not a substitute for professional medical advice.
- Consult a healthcare professional for accurate diagnosis and guidance.
